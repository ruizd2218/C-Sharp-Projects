---This is my C-Sharp projects repository---

Contained in this repository, I have my Car Insurance project, as well as
some smaller, much more basic programs.

The Car Insurance allows you to input information about yourself, and calculates a
car insurance mock-quote for you. This utilizes the MVC design pattern and .NET and Entity 
frameworks
